# Simple filesystem

Implementation of a rudimentary filesystem in C. It is mountable so can be tested and stuff. I wrote and ran it on Ubuntu 16.04. For detailed information about mplementation, read the comments inside each file. The comments are very detailed and will be copied into this readme sometime in thefuture.
